# AI Error Message Study

This project was completed as part of Carnegie Mellon University’s 05-618: Human-AI Interaction Course. The goal is to study how different AI error message types affect user trust and willingness to continue using AI chatbots as learning tools.

Deployed at: https://anissakp.github.io/ai-error-study/

## Overview

This project consists of three chatbot variants that demonstrate different error communication strategies:
- **Chatbot A**: Actionable guidance (acknowledges the error, provides correct solution, explains helpful steps, educational and constructive)
- **Chatbot B**: Simple apology (apologizes sincerely, expresses empathy, does NOT provide solution, emotional support only)
- **Chatbot C**: Defensive blame-shifting (subtly blames user, suggests communication was unclear, defensive tone, does NOT provide solution)
